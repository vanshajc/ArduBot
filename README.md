# ArduBot

#### **Description**  
The goal of this project is to teach a robot running on an Arduino to learn to drive around an environment by itself. 
This will be done by training the robot in simulation with deep reinforcement learning, penalizing on hitting obstacles and rewarding for distance traveled.

Currently, the simulation is being developed.

#### **Dependencies**   
Python3 (Tested on Python3.7)  
Pygame

#### **How to run:**  
In order to run the simulation:  
`./launch_game.sh`
